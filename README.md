Week 11 Practice 


This practice project is to create a simple chatbot. All the files have been provided.

First, the user must use visual studio and install the python extension. The user must download the project files and save them to the folder in visual studio. (Note* the user must unzip the ChatterBot-soacy_fixed file) Then the user must install python and activate the python environment. 

Next the user must do the following commands: 
python3 -m pip install flask (install flask)
python3 -m pip install pandas numpy matplotlib sklearn (install other libraries)
pip install ./ChatterBot-spacy_fixed (install ChatterBot-spacy_fixed)
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm (install en_core_web_sm)
python3 app.py (run given app) 

When the app runs, make sure to open the html link in the internet browser in order to see the chatbot. 


For this practice, new items have been added to the conversation list in the chat.py file.
